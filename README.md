- My background is in languages and education, focusing on edtech solutions for language learning. This is what first inspired me to get into development. Having used edtech tools as both a teacher and learner for many years, I've seen how good tools can be used to create fun, engaging and meaningful learning experiences. (I've also seen how the bad ones create more work, stress and steal time from both teachers and learners)
   
- ðŸŒ± I'm looking into the use of AI for language learning 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working in digital learning, blending instructional design, UX/UI and front end development.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm also a project collaborator at The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO United Nations).
